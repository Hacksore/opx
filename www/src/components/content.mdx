### Overview
This is a CLI meant to enhance the native [1Passwords native CLI (`op`)](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/) simplifying the developer experience.

While you can run the following 1Password `op run` CLI there is a bit of manual effort to pass the additional flags where each one of your `.env` files is located.

```
op run --env-file=.env -- pnpm start
```

With `opx` it will scan you current working directory for any `.env` files and load them as variadic `--env-file` argument(s).

### Installing
Ensure you have installed an configured the [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started). Then you can Install the `opx` CLI utility with cargo.
```
cargo install opx
```

### Usage
You need to have at least one `.env` file in any folder of your project and it must [reference a secret from 1Password](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/secrets-environment-variables/#use-environment-env-files).
```shell
APPLE_ID="op://overlayed/apple_id/credential"
```

Start your application to inject the secrets as environment variables. 
```
opx
```

It will check [`packageManager`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/all.html#all_packages_packagemanager) definition and use that start your app. The default package manager is `npm` and the default script is `start`. You can run any script in your applications `package.json` with `opx <args>`.


Example running this [demo application](https://github.com/Hacksore/demo-1pass-secrets).

```shell
$ opx
[OPX] Using package manager pnpm 
[OPX] Forcing terminal colors with FORCE_COLOR=1
[OPX] op run \
        --env-file=apps/demo/.env \
        --env-file=apps/other-app/.env -- pnpm start
demo:start: Hello this is a sample app that uses a secret from 1password cli
demo:start: Secret is: <concealed by 1Password>
other-app:start: Hello this is a sample app that uses a secret from 1password cli
other-app:start: Secret is: <concealed by 1Password>
```
